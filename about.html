  <h1>About Dhanani Cyber</h1>
  <p>
    Dhanani Cyber is a cybersecurity consulting firm serving small and mid-sized
    businesses across the United States.
  </p>

  <p>
    We help organizations understand their cyber risk, make informed decisions,
    and strengthen their security posture in a practical and sustainable way.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Effective security should be understandable, prioritized, and aligned
    with how a business operates.
  </p>

  <p>
    We focus on clarity, transparency, and actionable guidance rather than
    fear-driven messaging or unnecessary complexity.
  </p>

  <h2>What Clients Can Expect</h2>
  <p>
    Professional assessments, objective recommendations, and clear communication
    throughout the engagement.
