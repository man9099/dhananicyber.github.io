  <h1>Our Approach</h1>
  <p>
    Our approach focuses on understanding how your business operates before
    making recommendations. Security should support the business, not slow it down.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Discovery</h2>
  <p>
    We begin by learning about your organization, business goals, systems,
    and operational constraints.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    We review existing security practices, processes, and controls across
    technical and administrative areas.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Risk Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Identified issues are evaluated based on likelihood and potential business impact,
    allowing us to focus on what matters most.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    Findings are translated into clear, plain-English recommendations
    designed for leadership and decision-makers.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    We deliver a prioritized roadmap that outlines realistic actions
    your organization can take to reduce risk over time.
  </p>

  <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell software or products. Our guidance is objective,
    business-focused, and tailored to your organization’s needs.
